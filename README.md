### Code

This repository is a fork of the official authors implementation associated with the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering".

The code for "Compact 3D Scene Representation via Self-Organizing Gaussian Grids" consists of multiple parts. The multi-dimensional sorting algorithm, PLAS, is available under the Apache License at [fraunhoferhhi/PLAS](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/PLAS).

The integration of the sorting, the smoothness regularization and the compression code for training and compressing 3D scenes is available in this repository.
